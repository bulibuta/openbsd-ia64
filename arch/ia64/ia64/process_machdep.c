/*
 * This file may seem a bit stylized, but that so that it's easier to port.
 * Functions to be implemented here are:
 *
 * process_read_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Get the current user-visible register set from the process
 *	and copy it into the regs structure (<machine/reg.h>).
 *	The process is stopped at the time read_regs is called.
 *
 * process_write_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Update the current register set from the passed in regs
 *	structure.  Take care to avoid clobbering special CPU
 *	registers or privileged bits in the PSL.
 *	The process is stopped at the time write_regs is called.
 *
 * process_sstep(proc)
 *	Arrange for the process to trap after executing a single instruction.
 *
 * process_set_pc(proc)
 *	Set the process's program counter.
